And we campaign for the changes that will make bad information rarer and less harmful.",

Of the 42 MPs we\u2019ve asked to correct the record this year, only 12 have done so. This isn\u2019t good enough!\r\n\r\nIn a world with more information than ever before, it\u2019s hard to know what to trust. And trusting the wrong thing can have real-world implications; especially in an election year. \r\n\r\nWhen our MPs and media make incorrect claims, and when false and misleading information is spread online, we all suffer.",
